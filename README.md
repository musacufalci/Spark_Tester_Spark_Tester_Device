# Spark Tester

- Hardware and Embedded Software of Spark Tester Spark Tester

- Spark Tester The Spark Tester is designed to test the adequacy of the cable insulation / insulation in accordance with the TS EN 62230 standard. 
By placing the cable on the production line, it ensures that the distortions, holes and faults that may occur in the cable insulation during 
production are detected quickly and with high precision. With the Spark Device, it can generate sine voltage waves up to 15kV at the mains 
frequency (50/60 Hz) and can be applied to cable insulation through bead electrodes along a 60 cm channel. Testing can be applied to a 
cable up to 200 meters per minute. The bead chains and the spacing of the bead chains used in the electrode of the device are designed 
according to the relevant standard requirements.
